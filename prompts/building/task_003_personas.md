# TASK 003: Persona Mastery & Tech-Stack Awareness

## Context
VibeCheck now understands the project structure (Task 002). Now we want to make the "Refined Prompt" more powerful by adding specialized expertise and technical context.

## Objectives
1.  **Tech-Stack Discovery:**
    - Build a tool `detect_tech_stack` that reads `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, or `go.mod` to identify the primary frameworks and libraries.
    - Update `refine_vibe_prompt` to include a "Tech Stack Detected" section in its output.
2.  **Persona Support:**
    - Update the `refine_vibe_prompt` tool to accept a `persona` argument (e.g., "Senior Engineer", "Product Manager", "Security Auditor").
    - Based on the persona, the refinement logic should add specific "Expert Constraints" (e.g., Security Auditor focuses on input validation and SQL injection).
3.  **Dependency Intelligence:**
    - If the user's prompt mentions a library (e.g., "React"), the server should check if that library is in the `package.json` and report its version.
4.  **CLI Interface Improvement:**
    - Ensure all output is formatted with clean Markdown and emojis (Henry-style).

## Specs
- Add a `Personas` configuration object in `index.ts`.
- Personas should include: `Default`, `Senior Engineer`, `Product Manager`, `Security Auditor`, `Performance Specialist`.
- Update the Zod schema for the tool inputs.

## Git
Commit the changes and move this task file to `prompts/completed/` once done.
