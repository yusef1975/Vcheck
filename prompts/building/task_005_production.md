# TASK 005: Advanced MCP Features & Distribution Prep

## Context
Task 004 is complete. VibeCheck is now a feature-rich MCP server with scoring, history, and iterative refinement. Now we need to prepare it for "Production" by adding structured documentation, configuration support, and advanced MCP features.

## Objectives
1.  **Configuration File Support:**
    - Allow the server to read a `.vibecheckrc` JSON file in the project root to override default personas or ignored directories.
    - Create a tool `init_vibecheck` that generates a default `.vibecheckrc` and `.gitignore` entries.
2.  **MCP Resources:**
    - Implement an MCP **Resource** `vibecheck://history` that allows other agents to read the prompt history directly as a data stream.
    - Implement a resource `vibecheck://rules` that exposes the current refinement principles.
3.  **Prompt Templates:**
    - Add a `list_vibe_templates` tool that returns common "Starter Prompts" (e.g., "New Feature", "Refactor", "Bug Fix", "Test Suite").
4.  **SaaS Landing Page Assets:**
    - Create a `docs/` folder.
    - Write a high-converting `docs/pitch.md` for the SaaS landing page, explaining why VibeCheck is essential for vibe coders.
5.  **Build & Package:**
    - Update `package.json` with a `build` script (tsc) and a `bin` field so it can be installed via `npm install -g`.

## Specs
- Use the MCP `server.resource()` API for the history and rules.
- The `pitch.md` should be written in Henry's "CEO mentor" voice.

## Git
Commit the changes and move this task file to `prompts/completed/` once done.
