# TASK 002: Context Awareness & File Suggestion

## Context
Task 001 is complete. We have a basic MCP server that can refine prompts with text-based rules. Now we need to make it "Context Aware" by allowing it to see the project structure.

## Objectives
1.  **Project Scanning:** Add a helper function that scans the current working directory (excluding `node_modules`, `.git`, etc.) and returns a flat list of file paths.
2.  **New Tool: `suggest_vibe_context`**
    - **Input:** `query` (string - what the user wants to do).
    - **Logic:** Search the file list (from step 1) for filenames that match the query (e.g., if user says "fix the login", look for `login`, `auth`, `user` files).
    - **Output:** A list of suggested files to include in the prompt.
3.  **Enhance `refine_vibe_prompt`:**
    - Update the tool to automatically call the "suggest context" logic.
    - If it finds relevant files, it should append a "Recommended Context" section to the refined prompt, listing those files.
4.  **Testing:** Ensure the server handles large directories gracefully (ignore `node_modules`).

## Git
Commit the changes and move this task file to `prompts/completed/` once done.
